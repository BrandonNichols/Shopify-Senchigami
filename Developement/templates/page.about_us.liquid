        Who is Senchigami? Who are we? 


Senchigami is an online apparel brand inspired by Eastern Pop Culture. You’ve probably heard something like that before, and maybe you think you know what to expect when you check us out. After all, there are a lot of brands out there ‘inspired’ by Eastern Pop Culture, but to them, it’s just a look. 


Senchigami was inspired by the messages and themes of the Anime, Manga and other forms of Eastern media we love.

  We’re inspired by the ideas of reaching above, giving it your all, and going even further beyond.  We’re driven by everything you’ve heard your favorite heroes shout in their darkest moment, right before they win. 


  We started as a team of 5, and all of us had our own reasons for founding Senchigami, but we bonded over our drive to reach greater heights through our creative expression. We knew we could get more out of life if we just followed our dreams, whether that was creating art, telling stories or bringing people together.

  It’s easy to slip into the day to day grind of life. You get stuck doing the same thing each morning. Maybe you wake up and dread your job. Maybe you don’t know what you’re gonna do after you’re done with school. Maybe you don’t know what you’re going to do at all. Senchigami was founded on the idea that you KNOW you can do more than what you’re doing right now.
